# User Story Writing

## Overview

Well-written user stories communicate requirements in a user-focused way, facilitate discussion, and provide clear acceptance criteria for developers and testers.

## When to Use

- Breaking down requirements into development tasks
- Product backlog creation and refinement
- Agile sprint planning
- Communicating features to development team
- Defining acceptance criteria
- Creating test cases

## Instructions

### 1. **User Story Format**

````markdown
# User Story Template

**Title:** [Feature name]
**Story ID:** [USR-000 / HU 000]
**Status:** [Draft | In Refinement | Approved]
**Version:** [v1.0]

**As a** [user role/persona]
**I want to** [action/capability]
**So that** [business value/benefit]

---

## Context

- **As:** [Role(s) that use this feature]
- **I want:** [Desired capability]
- **So that:** [Business/audit/compliance value]
- **Stakeholders:** [Product Owner, Business Area, Compliance, Tech Lead]

---

## Assumptions

- [Operational/system assumption 1]
- [Data/source assumption 2]
- [Access/security assumption 3]
- [Default behavior assumption when no filter/parameter is informed]

---

## User Context

- User Role: [Who is performing this action?]
- User Goals: [What are they trying to accomplish?]
- Use Case: [When do they perform this action?]

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. [Scenario name]
- **Given** [precondition]
- **When** [action]
- **Then** [expected result]

### 2. [Access restriction]
- **Given** [user without required profile]
- **When** [tries to access feature]
- **Then** [block access and display standard denial message]

### 3. [Filter criteria]
- **Given** [user fills one or more filters]
- **When** [submits filtering]
- **Then** [apply combined filters using logical AND]

### 4. [Date range filter]
- **Given** [initial and/or final date provided]
- **When** [filter is executed]
- **Then** [return events in period and validate date consistency]

### 5. [Details view]
- **Given** [user selects one record]
- **When** [clicks "Details"]
- **Then** [show full event metadata and payload]

### 6. [Export]
- **Given** [filtered result set]
- **When** [clicks "Export"]
- **Then** [generate file containing only visible/filtered records]

### 7. [Pagination]
- **Given** [large result set]
- **When** [accesses listing]
- **Then** [show paginated results with navigation controls]

Example:
Given a user is logged in and viewing their cart
When they add a product to cart
Then the cart count increases and success message appears

- Exported file must include a header row.
- Filename pattern: `[feature]_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.[csv|pdf]`.

### Pagination Rules

- Default page size: [e.g., 20 items].
- Allow page navigation and total count visibility.
- Preserve active filters when changing pages.

### 2. **Story Refinement Process**

```python
# Story refinement and quality gates

        'Small': 'Can be completed in one sprint',
        'Testable': 'Clear acceptance criteria'
    }

                    ]
                },
                {
                    'topic': 'Estimation',

                'Team agreement on scope'
            ]
        }
```

### 3. **Acceptance Criteria Examples**

```yaml
Story: As a customer, I want to save payment methods so I can checkout faster

Acceptance Criteria:

Scenario 1: Add a new payment method
  Given I'm logged in
  And I'm on the payment settings page
  When I click "Add payment method"
  And I enter valid payment details
  And I click "Save"
  Then the payment method is saved
  And I see a success message
  And the new method appears in my saved list

Scenario 2: Edit existing payment method
  Given I have saved payment methods
  When I click "Edit" on a method
  And I change the expiration date
  And I click "Save"
  Then the changes are saved
  And other fields are unchanged

Scenario 3: Delete a payment method
  Given I have multiple saved payment methods
  When I click "Delete" on a method
  And I confirm the deletion
  Then the method is removed
  And my default method is updated if needed

Scenario 4: Error handling
  Given I enter invalid payment information
  When I click "Save"
  Then I see an error message
  And the method is not saved
  And I'm returned to the form to correct

Scenario 5: Security
  Given the payment form is displayed
  When I view the page source
  Then I don't see full payment numbers (PCI compliance)
  And credit card data is encrypted
  And the connection is HTTPS

---

Non-Functional Requirements:
  - Performance: Form save must complete in <2 seconds
  - Usability: Form must be completable in <3 steps
  - Reliability: 99.9% uptime for payment service
  - Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
  - Security: PCI DSS Level 1 compliance
```

### 4. **Story Splitting**

```javascript
// Breaking large stories into smaller pieces

class StorySpitting {
  SPLITTING_STRATEGIES = [
    'By workflow step',
    'By user role',
    'By CRUD operation',
    'By business rule',
    'By technical layer',
    'By risk/complexity',
    'By priority'
  ];

  splitLargeStory(largeStory) {
    return {
      original_story: largeStory.title,
      original_points: largeStory.story_points,
      strategy: 'Split by workflow step',
      split_stories: [
        {
          id: 'US-201',
          title: 'Add payment method - Form UI',
          points: 3,
          description: 'Build payment form UI with validation',
          depends_on: 'None',
          priority: 'First'
        },
        {
          id: 'US-202',
          title: 'Add payment method - Backend API',
          points: 5,
          description: 'Create API endpoint to save payment method',
          depends_on: 'US-201',
          priority: 'Second'
        },
        {
          id: 'US-203',
          title: 'Add payment method - Integration',
          points: 3,
          description: 'Connect form to API, handle responses',
          depends_on: 'US-202',
          priority: 'Third'
        },
        {
          id: 'US-204',
          title: 'Add payment method - Security hardening',
          points: 2,
          description: 'PCI compliance, encryption, data protection',
          depends_on: 'US-202',
          priority: 'Critical'
        }
      ],
      total_split_points: 13,
      complexity_reduction: 'From 13pt single story to 5pt max',
      benefits: [
        'Faster feedback cycles',
        'Parallel development possible',
        'Easier testing',
        'Clearer scope per story'
      ]
    };
  }
}
```

### 5. **Story Estimation**

```yaml
Story Pointing Framework:

1 Point: Trivial
  - Update label text
  - Add CSS class
  - Simple config change
  - Time: <2 hours

2 Points: Very small
  - Add simple field to form
  - Update error message
  - Simple validation
  - Time: 2-4 hours

3 Points: Small
  - Create single page/component
  - Add basic API endpoint
  - Simple integration
  - Time: 4-8 hours

5 Points: Medium
  - Create feature with multiple interactions
  - Build API with multiple endpoints
  - Complex business logic
  - Time: 1-2 days

8 Points: Large
  - Feature spanning multiple pages
  - Complex integration
  - Multiple technical challenges
  - Time: 2-3 days

13 Points: Very large (TOO BIG - Split it!)
  - Should be split into smaller stories
  - Or elevated to epic
  - Time: >3 days

---

Estimation Tips:
  - Use relative sizing (compare to known stories)
  - Consider unknowns and risks
  - Include non-coding time (testing, docs)
  - Account for team skill level
  - Be transparent about assumptions
  - Re-estimate after learning
```

## Best Practices

### ✅ DO
- Write from the user's perspective
- Focus on value, not implementation
- Create stories small enough for one sprint
- Define clear acceptance criteria
- Use consistent format and terminology
- Have product owner approve stories
- Include edge cases and error scenarios
- Link to requirements/business goals
- Update stories based on learning
- Create testable stories

### ❌ DON'T
- Write technical task-focused stories
- Create overly detailed specifications
- Write stories that require multiple sprints
- Forget about non-functional requirements
- Skip acceptance criteria
- Create dependent stories unnecessarily
- Write ambiguous acceptance criteria
- Ignore edge cases
- Create too large stories
- Change stories mid-sprint without discussion

## User Story Tips

- Keep stories focused on user value
- Use story splitting when >5 points
- Always include acceptance criteria
- Review stories with team before sprint
- Update definitions of done as team learns
